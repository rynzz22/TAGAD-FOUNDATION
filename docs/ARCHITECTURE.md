## 2. Dual-Sided Portal Boundary

1. **Public Side (`/` and `#demographics`, `#programs`)**:
   * Anonymous access allowed.
   * Exposes aggregated numbers only (Budget totals, barangay counts).
   * **Zero PII Exposure**: Individual beneficiary names, contact info, and internal remarks are inaccessible.

2. **Authenticated Administrative Workspace (`/dashboard`, `/programs`, etc.)**:
   * Requires authenticated session (Supabase Auth / JWT).
   * Verified by `ProtectedRoute` on frontend and PostgreSQL RLS on database.
   * Full CRUD operations restricted by role (`super_admin`, `admin`, `editor`, `municipal_admin`, `barangay_admin`).

## 3. Data Ownership & Auditability

Every mutable table adheres to the universal metadata contract:
* `id`: UUID Primary Key
* `created_at`: UTC Timestamp (auto-populated by PostgreSQL `NOW()`)
* `updated_at`: UTC Timestamp (maintained via `BEFORE UPDATE` database trigger)
* `created_by`: Foreign key to `public.users(id)`
* `updated_by`: Foreign key to `public.users(id)`

All critical state changes trigger an entry into `public.audit_logs` capturing user ID, action type, before/after JSON state, and client context.
